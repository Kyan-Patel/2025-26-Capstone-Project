  <h2>Educational Purpose & Honeypots</h2>
  <p>
    This web application is designed for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. The goal is to help students understand how Wi-Fi networks and security tools work in a controlled, safe environment. No real attacks are performed — all activity shown is simulated for learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Honeypots</strong> are security tools that mimic real systems, networks, or services to attract potential attackers. By observing how attacks interact with a honeypot, students and security researchers can learn about common threats, techniques, and safe defense strategies without putting real networks or devices at risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simulated logs, alerts, and Wi-Fi activity in this site give a hands-on look at how honeypots collect information and help improve cybersecurity awareness — all in a safe, controlled setting.
